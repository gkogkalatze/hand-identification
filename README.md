Hand Identification System for RGB and Hyperspectral Images

Welcome to the repository for the Hand Identification System project! This project focuses on developing an image processing system that can recognize individuals based on hand images. The system includes two main components: one for processing RGB images and another for processing hyperspectral images.
Project Description

The aim of this project is to build a robust and accurate hand identification system that can analyze both RGB and hyperspectral images. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system is designed to identify individuals based on their unique hand characteristics.

The project has been successfully completed and includes two separate folders, each dedicated to processing a specific type of image:

    RGB Image Processing System: This folder contains the code and resources for processing RGB images. It utilizes advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning models to extract relevant features from RGB hand images.

    Hyperspectral Image Processing System: This folder contains the code and resources for processing hyperspectral images. Hyperspectral imaging captures a wide range of spectral bands, providing more detailed information about the hand's surface. The system leverages hyperspectral image analysis techniques to identify individuals based on these spectral signatures.

Data Sources

The hand images used in this project were acquired from the following sources:

    RGB Images: Hand images for the RGB image processing system were provided by Dr. Mahmoud Afifi from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. We are grateful for their contribution, which helped us in developing and testing our system.

    Hyperspectral Images: Hand images for the hyperspectral image processing system were obtained from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. We sincerely appreciate their collaboration and the availability of the hyperspectral image dataset, which enabled us to train and evaluate our system.
